# Distributed Sort Using Multithreaded Programming (Unfinished)

This program was created in order to acheave a distributed computing approach to the simple bubble sort algorithm
(more types of sorts with the distributed computing program will come in the future)

This program will work by splitting a randomly generated set of numbers into roughly equal groups and each group
will be sorted by an available processor. After each group is sorted they are then merged together into one sorted
group.
